Over the years, my go-to techniques when dealing with imbalanced classes have been:

oversampling the under-represented class: I used to think that this method would always yield overfitting but that's not the case. This paper that I discovered thanks to fastai courses changed my mind with respect to oversampling. The paper compares different methods of dealing with imbalanced data in the context of CNN. Here are the conclusions of the paper


:boom: You don't need to do that anymore! :smile: Here's how easy it is:

```js
import customFonts from 'custom-fonts-in-emails';
import path from 'path';

const options = {
  text: 'Make something people want',
  fontNameOrPath: 'GoudyBookletter1911',
  fontColor: 'white',
  backgroundColor: '#ff6600',
  fontSize: 40
};

customFonts.png2x(options)
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error);
```
